# IcoSphere a FPS game 
## Final project for "CS50's Introduction to Game Development"

*My purpose in this is mainly to improve my skills in scripting in C#*
*and to get more familiar with working with the UnityEngine*

It is a short ego-shooter adventure were the player has to fight
his/her way to the endboss.
On the way are continously spawning sphere shaped floating
enemies which try to tackle the player or shoot spikes toward him/her.
To stop enemys from spawning and clear the way to new sections,
the player has to capture and defend circular zones on his way.
Starting with a laser gun after the first half the player gains a fully
automatic weapon on which a heating feature was implemented
(If used to long it has to cool down before further usage).
Furthermore the endboss scene features jump- and speed-pads
which interact with the FPS controller and a laser mechanism
which has to be activated with four capture Zones to assist 
defeating the endboss.
If the player looses all health the game is over.
